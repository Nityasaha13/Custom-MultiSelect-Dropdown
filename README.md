# Custom Multi-Select Dropdown

This custom multi-select dropdown enhances form usability by allowing users to select multiple options while displaying each choice as a removable tag. When the number of selected items exceeds a set limit, the dropdown condenses the view with a "+count" feature, ensuring the interface remains clean and easy to navigate.

Perfect for scenarios requiring multi-selection, this dropdown integrates smoothly into any project, offering a responsive and accessible solution. The component improves user interaction in forms and filter systems, providing an intuitive, tag-based UI for managing multiple selections without overwhelming the user.
